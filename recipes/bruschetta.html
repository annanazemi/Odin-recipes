    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We like things to be simple — wholesome ingredients, fresh flavors, and few ingredients. So when we find something we love, we make it often. Did you know most people have five to ten recipes they rotate throughout the year? We’re no different, which is why we make this simple bruschetta recipe with tomato and fresh basil all the time — especially during the summer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 loaf Italian bread, cut into 1/2-inch diagonal slices</li>
